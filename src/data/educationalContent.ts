    title: "Photosynthesis",
    concept: "Photosynthesis is how plants make food using sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide in their chloroplasts (green chlorophyll). Equation: 6CO‚ÇÇ + 6H‚ÇÇO + Light Energy ‚Üí C‚ÇÜH‚ÇÅ‚ÇÇO‚ÇÜ (glucose) + 6O‚ÇÇ. Plants are producers - they don't eat, they make their own food! This process powers almost all life on Earth.",
    example: "One large tree produces 118 kg of oxygen per year - enough for 2 people! Amazon rainforest creates 20% of Earth's oxygen. A single leaf has millions of chloroplasts doing photosynthesis. Without plants, atmospheric CO‚ÇÇ would skyrocket, causing extreme global warming. Indoor plants improve air quality in homes!",
    funFact: "Jan Ingenhousz discovered photosynthesis in 1779! Ancient cyanobacteria started producing oxygen 2.4 billion years ago - The Great Oxygenation Event that made animal life possible! Some bacteria do photosynthesis using sulfur instead of water. Mangalore's mangroves sequester 4x more CO‚ÇÇ than regular forests!",
    emoji: "üå±",
    question: "Scientists are designing artificial photosynthesis to combat climate change. If a 100 sq meter artificial leaf system absorbs 150 kg of CO‚ÇÇ daily (like 5 trees), how much CO‚ÇÇ could a 1 hectare (10,000 sq meter) facility absorb in a year?",
    options: ["547,500 kg", "54,750 kg", "5,475,000 kg", "5,475 kg"],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: "100 m¬≤ = 150 kg/day. 10,000 m¬≤ = (10,000/100)√ó150 = 1,500 kg/day. Per year = 1,500√ó365 = 547,500 kg = 547.5 tons of CO‚ÇÇ! This technology could help reverse climate change!",

    title: "Gravity",
    concept: "Gravity is the force that attracts objects with mass toward each other. Earth's gravity pulls us down with 9.8 m/s¬≤ acceleration. Mass = amount of matter (stays same everywhere). Weight = mass √ó gravity (changes on different planets). Discovered by Isaac Newton (1687) and explained by Einstein's General Relativity (1915).",
    example: "If you weigh 40 kg on Earth, you'd weigh 6.6 kg on Moon (1/6th gravity), 15 kg on Mars (38% gravity), 94.8 kg on Jupiter (2.37x gravity)! Astronauts appear weightless in ISS not because there's no gravity, but because they're constantly falling around Earth - that's an orbit!",
    funFact: "Ancient Indian astronomer Brahmagupta described gravity in 628 CE - 1,000 years before Newton! Black holes have gravity so strong that even light can't escape! Gravity waves exist - LIGO detected them in 2015. Earth's gravity isn't uniform - it's slightly weaker at Equator due to rotation!",
    emoji: "üåç",
    question: "ISRO's Chandrayaan-3 landed on Moon in 2023. If the lander weighs 1,750 kg on Earth, what would be its weight on Moon's surface? (Moon gravity = 1/6th of Earth's)",
    options: ["291.67 kg", "10,500 kg", "1,750 kg", "875 kg"],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: "Weight on Moon = Earth weight √∑ 6 = 1,750 √∑ 6 = 291.67 kg. But its MASS remains 1,750 kg everywhere! This lower weight helped Chandrayaan use less fuel for landing. Understanding gravity is key to space missions!",

    example: "Usain Bolt's 100m world record: 9.58 seconds = 10.44 m/s = 37.58 km/h! India's fastest train Vande Bharat reaches 180 km/h. Speed of light = 3√ó10‚Å∏ m/s. Sound travels at 343 m/s in air. A cheetah runs 120 km/h but only for 30 seconds - speed vs endurance!",
    funFact: "ISRO's Mars Orbiter Mission traveled 680 million km at average 36,000 km/h! Parker Solar Probe is fastest human-made object at 635,000 km/h! Internet speed is measured in Mbps (megabits per second). Indian runner Neeraj Chopra's javelin flies at 100+ km/h!",
