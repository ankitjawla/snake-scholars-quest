    title: "Large Numbers",
    ncertChapter: "Chapter 1: We the Travellers - I",
    concept: "Big numbers are everywhere! Like counting all students in India or stars in the sky. We use place values: Ones, Tens, Hundreds, Thousands, Ten Thousands, Lakhs! Each place is 10 times bigger than the one before it.",
    example: "India has about 1,40,00,00,000 people! That's 1 Arab 40 Crore or 1.4 billion. To read it: Put commas from right in groups - 1,40,00,00,000. Easy peasy!",
    funFact: "A 'Googol' is 1 followed by 100 zeros! That's where Google got its name (but spelled differently). Also, the biggest number with a name is 'Googolplex' = 10 to the power of Googol! ü§Ø",

      "5,000 (Five thousand)",
      "500 (Five hundred)",
      "5 (Five)"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: "The 5 is in the ten thousands place! So 5 √ó 10,000 = 50,000. Count from right: Ones, Tens, Hundreds, Thousands, Ten Thousands!",
    learningOutcome: "Read and write large numbers up to 1 lakh using place values",
    assessmentQuestions: [

    title: "Fractions - Parts of a Whole",
    ncertChapter: "Chapter 2: Fractions",
    concept: "A fraction shows a part of something! Like eating 3 out of 8 pizza slices = 3/8. Top number (numerator) = parts you have. Bottom number (denominator) = total equal parts.",
    example: "Your phone battery is at 3/4. That means 3 parts full out of 4 total parts. Same as 75%! If you use 1/4 more battery, you'll have: 3/4 + 1/4 = 4/4 = Full battery! üîã",
    funFact: "Ancient Egyptians only used fractions with 1 on top! Like 1/2, 1/3, 1/4. To write 3/4, they'd write 1/2 + 1/4. Pretty cool math tricks! üßÆ",
    emoji: "üçï",
    question: "Ramya ate 2/5 of a chocolate bar. Her friend ate 1/5. What fraction did they eat together?",
    options: ["3/5", "3/10", "2/6", "1/5"],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: "Same denominator, so just add numerators: 2/5 + 1/5 = (2+1)/5 = 3/5. Easy!",
    learningOutcome: "Add and subtract fractions with same denominators",
    assessmentQuestions: [
      {
        question: "What is 1/2 + 1/2?",
        options: ["1 (one whole)", "2/4", "1/4", "2/2"],
        correctAnswer: 0,
        explanation: "1/2 + 1/2 = 2/2 = 1 whole! Two halves make one complete thing!"
      },
      {
        question: "Which is bigger: 3/8 or 2/8?",
        options: ["3/8", "2/8", "Both equal", "Can't compare"],
        correctAnswer: 0,
        explanation: "Same denominator, so compare numerators: 3 > 2, so 3/8 is bigger!"
      },
      {
        question: "If you have 5/6 of a cake and eat 2/6, how much is left?",
        options: ["3/6", "7/6", "3/12", "5/12"],
        correctAnswer: 0,
        explanation: "Subtract: 5/6 - 2/6 = (5-2)/6 = 3/6. That's also equal to 1/2!"

    title: "Addition & Subtraction - Big Numbers",
    ncertChapter: "Chapter 4: We the Travellers - II",
    concept: "Adding = putting things together. Subtracting = taking away. For big numbers, line them up by place value (ones under ones, tens under tens). Carry over when needed!",
    example: "A library has 1,248 books. Gets 567 new books. Total = 1,248 + 567 = 1,815 books! If 392 are borrowed: 1,815 - 392 = 1,423 books left.",
    funFact: "The + and - symbols were invented in Germany around 1489! Before that, people wrote 'plus' and 'minus' with full words. Imagine writing homework then! üòÖ",

        options: ["4,544", "4,456", "5,544", "4,644"],
        correctAnswer: 0,
        explanation: "Borrow from zeros: 7,000 becomes 6,10,10,10. Then subtract: 10-6=4, 10-5=4, 10-4=5, 6-2=4. So 4,544!"

    ncertChapter: "Chapter 9: Division",
    concept: "Multiplication is super-fast addition! Instead of adding 5 + 5 + 5 + 5, just do 5 √ó 4 = 20. It's like having groups of the same size.",
    example: "A garden has 24 rows with 18 plants each. Total plants = 24 √ó 18 = 432 plants. Way faster than counting one by one!",
    funFact: "Ancient Babylonians made the first multiplication tables 4,000 years ago on clay tablets! Indian mathematician Brahmagupta taught multiplying negative numbers in 628 CE. Math is ancient! üèõÔ∏è",
