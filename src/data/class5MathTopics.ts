    title: "Large Numbers",
    ncertChapter: "Chapter 1: We the Travellers - I",
    concept: "Big numbers are everywhere! Like counting all students in India or stars in the sky. We use place values: Ones, Tens, Hundreds, Thousands, Ten Thousands, Lakhs! Each place is 10 times bigger than the one before it.",
    example: "India has about 1,40,00,00,000 people! That's 1 Arab 40 Crore or 1.4 billion. To read it: Put commas from right in groups - 1,40,00,00,000. Easy peasy!",
    funFact: "A 'Googol' is 1 followed by 100 zeros! That's where Google got its name (but spelled differently). Also, the biggest number with a name is 'Googolplex' = 10 to the power of Googol! ü§Ø",

      "500 (Five hundred)",
      "5 (Five)"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: "The 5 is in the ten thousands place! So 5 √ó 10,000 = 50,000. Count from right: Ones, Tens, Hundreds, Thousands, Ten Thousands!",
    learningOutcome: "Read and write large numbers up to 1 lakh using place values",

    title: "Fractions - Parts of a Whole",
    ncertChapter: "Chapter 2: Fractions",
    concept: "A fraction shows a part of something! Like eating 3 out of 8 pizza slices = 3/8. Top number (numerator) = parts you have. Bottom number (denominator) = total equal parts.",
    example: "Your phone battery is at 3/4. That means 3 parts full out of 4 total parts. Same as 75%! If you use 1/4 more battery, you'll have: 3/4 + 1/4 = 4/4 = Full battery! üîã",
    funFact: "Ancient Egyptians only used fractions with 1 on top! Like 1/2, 1/3, 1/4. To write 3/4, they'd write 1/2 + 1/4. Pretty cool math tricks! üßÆ",

    title: "Addition & Subtraction - Big Numbers",
    ncertChapter: "Chapter 4: We the Travellers - II",
    concept: "Adding = putting things together. Subtracting = taking away. For big numbers, line them up by place value (ones under ones, tens under tens). Carry over when needed!",
    example: "A library has 1,248 books. Gets 567 new books. Total = 1,248 + 567 = 1,815 books! If 392 are borrowed: 1,815 - 392 = 1,423 books left.",

        correctAnswer: 0,
        explanation: "Borrow from zeros: 7,000 becomes 6,10,10,10. Then subtract: 10-6=4, 10-5=4, 10-4=5, 6-2=4. So 4,544!"
